                    <p>Business owners are struggling every day  to manage an overwhelming amount of tasks and information.</p>
                    
                    <p>From customer care and supplier relations to receiving merchandise and overseeing quality control, there’s always something that needs their immediate attention.</p>

                    <p>OCTA was designed to meet the unique needs of these business owners.  It was originally conceived as a Cloud app for small business owners to store & share information with their suppliers.  After conducting vigorous user research, that changed to reflect our target users needs and pain points.  OCTA evolved a couple steps further into an app that helps a busy business owner run their business better.  All tailored to their unique workflow.  As told by them.</p>

                <p>Google Drive, Camcard, and Neat are all cloud applications that business owners use to organize different aspects of their business.  Google Drive is an “all-in-one”, Camcard stores business contacts and posts news and updates, and Neat helps organize documents for accounting and tax time.  I look never look to compete directly with any of the competitors.  I look to create our own unique value by learning what these companies are doing right and what’s missing from their products for my audience.  </p>
